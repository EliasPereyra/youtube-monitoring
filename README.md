# Monitoring with Tickers

This is a simple project focus on how we can implement the tickers utility from in a real scenario, like in this case, monitor your Youtube's analytics.

## Server

For running the server, first you need to get your Youtube API keys from [Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
This project currently is using the Youtube Data API v3.

## Front-end

For running the front you need to have Node 18+. In this project I'm using `v18.19.0`.

The package manager I'm using is pnpm.
